This repository contains a collection of C programs demonstrating various programming concepts, including recursion, file I/O, structures, arrays, pointers, and basic user input/output operations. Each program is designed to illustrate fundamental C programming techniques.

Programs

Below is a list of the C programs included in this repository, along with their functionality:





recursive_numbers.c





Demonstrates a recursive function that prints numbers from 0 to 9.



volume_calculator.c





Calculates the volume of a rectangular prism given three dimensions (length, width, height).



array_passing.c





Shows three different methods to pass and print an array: fixed-size array, dynamic-size array, and pointer.



recursive_print.c





Uses two recursive functions to print numbers and asterisks in an interleaved pattern.



user_input.c





Prompts the user for a number and displays it.



char_return.c





Defines a function that returns a character ('Q') and prints it.



string_copy.c





Recursively copies a string from one array to another.



square_root.c





Calculates and prints the square root of 9.0 using the sqrt function.



pointer_return.c





Returns a pointer to a global variable and prints its value.



float_input.c





Prompts the user for a floating-point number and prints it.



bank_transaction.c





Reads names and account balances from myfile.txt and supports withdrawing or depositing money based on user input.



student_records.c





Uses a struct to store and print student information (name, roll number, CGPA) for 8 students.



file_copy.c





Reads a string from bd.txt and writes it to out.txt.



bank_transaction_file.c





Similar to bank_transaction.c, but also writes account details to out.txt. Note: This program contains a syntax error in the fprintf statement that needs correction.
